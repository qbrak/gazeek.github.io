The purpose of this post is to draw diagrams for how the different spaces in probability interact.
For this to be useful you need some course in probability and measure theory.

Here is a simple diagram with one randow variable $X$ and one probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$:

Then we can look at something more complicated case where we create a new random variable $Y=f(x)$ from $X$:
