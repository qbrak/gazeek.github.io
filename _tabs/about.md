This blog is a place where I write down my thoughts, in order to better understand them. I also hope that some of the things I write about will be useful to others.

Thus sometimes the posts will be wrong, and when I realize that, I will update them. I will try to make it clear when I am not sure about something.

The name qbrak (pronounced "queue-brack" like "frack" but with a 'b') is a reference to many things. The main idea is connected with not being [Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(Star_Trek)), since the word "brak" means "without" in Polish. Since  [Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(Star_Trek)) is arrogant, all-knowing, all-powerfull what I wanted is to *not* be like that. Additionally, qbrak sounds like "kubrak" an old Polish word for jacket, so it's kinda funny.

The logo was made starting with the word Q-naught ($Q_0$), again a reference to [Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(Star_Trek)) and not being him. Then Q-naught sounds like Q-knot hence the logo. It's also a reference to what I would like to do with this blog: un-knot ideas to make them understandable.

I hope you enjoy reading my blog.
